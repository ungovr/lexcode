# Contributing to lexcode

Thank you for helping. Two rules matter more than any other.

## Every rule is written here, from the activity's definition

Write a rule against the activity's published definition at
https://lexlint.io/activities and its exclusions, one activity at a time,
with the fixtures first: a positive fixture showing the act, and a negative
fixture for every exclusion the definition names. A rule that fires on a
negative fixture cannot merge.

## Never copy a rule from another rule set

Do not copy, translate or adapt any rule, pattern, fixture or message from
`semgrep-rules`, `opengrep-rules` or `privado-rules`, or from any other rule
set whose license limits how it may be used. The reason is their licenses:

- The Semgrep rules are under the Semgrep Rules License v1.0, which permits
  use for internal business purposes only.
- `opengrep-rules` and `privado-rules` carry the Commons Clause on top of
  their open license. The Commons Clause withholds "the right to Sell the
  Software", and defines Sell to include providing a product or service
  "whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of
  the Software", including hosting and consulting fees.

lexcode's rules are MIT, so anyone may use them for anything. One copied rule
would end that for the whole set. Every rule says so in its metadata:
`provenance: ungovr-original` and `license: MIT`.

## Running the tests

```
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```

The fixture tests download the pinned engine on first run, or use the one
named by `LEXCODE_ENGINE`.
