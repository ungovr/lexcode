# lexcode rule set

This directory is the rule set lexcode runs: one YAML rule per file, one
directory per LexLint activity, positive and negative fixtures beside each rule,
component maps for npm, PyPI and Go packages under `components/`, and
`classes.yml`, which gives every activity id in the pinned registry snapshot
(`registry.snapshot.json`, CC BY 4.0, credit "LexLint (UnGovr)") one detection
class. Every rule is original to UnGovr and MIT licensed. The recall table below
is measured against the truth sets, per activity.

<!-- recall:start -->
<!-- recall:end -->
